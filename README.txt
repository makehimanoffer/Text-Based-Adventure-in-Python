This is the readme for my Text based adventure in python
First of all:
	I've no comments put into it yet so they will be coming soon
	It is in python so you must have python to execute and whatnot
	it is not finished yet but is getting there slowly but surely
	It is my work solely, and is available for viewing and stuff, but
	any side tracks using this code(well the code use is fine,
but the plot is something that is mine and mine alone)
	This is purely a portfolio piece in nature but hopefully it 
will work out to be really good.
	Its mostly based on a book I wrote before with some multiple choice
adjustments
	One thing I've seen from Text based adventures is frustration: i try
avoid this by using a 'help me for people who may be stuck on what to do 
in places, this isn't necessary to use but is a nice feature.
